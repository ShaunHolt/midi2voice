A la ba ma Ar kan sas
I do love my ma and pa
Not that way that I do love you
Well, ho ly mo ley, me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've ne ver loved one like you
Man, oh man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy, pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you
Ah, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ah, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
La, la, la, la, take me home
Mommy, I'm coming home
I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and pay phone calls
I've been everywhere with you
That's true, laugh until we think we'll die
Barefoot onâ€¦
